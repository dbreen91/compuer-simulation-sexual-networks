A Computer Simulation of Sexual Networks in Humans
===================================================

A person may have any number of sexual partners within their life time, with each partner in turn also possibly 
having any number of sexual partners of their own. This results in network of sexual partners. The aim of this 
simulation is to emulate these networks in human society using certain parameters to see which ones have the 
greatest impact upon the size of these networks in terms of both volume and the length of time these networks 
are active for. It also aims to show what a typical sexual network may look like in todayâ€™s society.

The Model
===========

My model contains a number of objects. Each object has an age, level  of promiscuity and an upper/lower limit 
for the age of other objects that they can interact with. Birth and death rates within the population are also simulated. simulated. A separate data structure keeps track of the interactions that have taken place. The simulation will be run in cycles of 10 years.
